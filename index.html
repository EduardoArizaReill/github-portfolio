      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>I am support focused, reliable, and curious; I help my team keep things running smoothly. I’ve spent the last few years working on internal projects and operations: troubleshooting, documenting, fixing broken processes, and making sure people have what they need to do their jobs. I’m comfortable digging through bugs, writing clean user guides, or training AI assistants to handle routine queries. I keep things practical, calm, and clear and I like working in the background to make systems (and people) work better.</p>
